This was a big C++ program I programmed in the fall of 2018. 
It was part of programming course in Tampere University. 
Project was intended to be 2 person endeavour but my randomly chosen pair
flunked out in the beginning of the course so I was in a hurry all the 
way trough. Sadly, this can be seen in the quality of the code.

Everything in UI folder is my code. 
Other parts of the code were provided by course staff.  

Game is a Qt project and should be compiled and run in Qt Creator.
