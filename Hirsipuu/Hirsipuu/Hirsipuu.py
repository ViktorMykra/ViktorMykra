# Hangman game
# Status: READY
"""
This program is Hangman-game. In the game you have to guess letters of a word
which the game chooses based on the difficulty you set in main menu. There are
three difficulty levels. EASY: *, chooses a word between 1 to 5 letters long.
HARD: ***, chooses a word between 5 to 8 letters long and PUNISHER: *****
creates 8 letters long nonsense word. You can choose the difficulty from the
 drop down menu in main menu. In the game you have six tries to guess
all the letters in the word. To guess a letter you have to click button with
the letter you want to guess on it. If the guessed letter is in the word, it
will appear on the right slot(s). If you fail to guess all the letters in
six tries, you will lose and die (in the game of course). If you do, you will
win. In the main menu there is also info, help and quit buttons. Info button
gives you some information about the program. Help button gives you the rules
of the game. Quit button shuts down the program. We hope you have fun time
playing our little game. We poured our hearts and souls into making it.

While making this program we aimed for the ease of use and portability for
touch screens. Thats why we made it playable by only a mouse. Also the
program is very robust because there is no action user can make that we didn't
think about. We aimed for the scalable level in this project. Scalability can
be seen in the game screen with the keyboard, answer slots and pictures. For
example there is always a correct amount of answer slots.
